# Write your code here. If you get stuck, at the very bottom of this lab we've included
# the answers. You should ONLY check those answers if you get totally stuck. The important
# thing is NOT to "complete labs," the important thing is to learn the skills you need
# in order to complete the rest of this course and be ready for the next course!

# Test 1;
def introduction(name) {
  return "Hi, my name is #{name}.";
}

# Test 2; return should be puts for Ruby!
def introduction_with_language(name, language) {
  return  "Hi, my name is #{name} and I am learning to program in #{language}.";
}

# Test 3;
def introduction_with_language_optional(name, language = "Ruby") {
  return "Hi, my name is #{name} and I am learning to program in #{language}.";
}


# Correct Solution...

def introduction(name)
  puts "Hi, my name is #{name}."
end

def introduction_with_language(name, language)
  puts "Hi, my name is #{name} and I am learning to program in #{language}."
end

def introduction_with_language_optional(name, language="Ruby")
  puts "Hi, my name is #{name} and I am learning to program in #{language}."
